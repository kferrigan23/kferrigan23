## Hi there 👋
My name's Kelly.

Here's some info about me:

- 🤓 I work as a technical writer/editor and have experience with DITA XML, such as Tridion Docs, Oxygen XML, and MadCap Flare, as well as with MS Word.
- 🖥  I recently learned web design and development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, SQL, PHP, and Markdown, to learn something new and to add to my skill set.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I'm looking to collaborate on anything I can to gain additional expertise in technical writing/editing and web design/development and to further experience GitHub.
- 👩‍💻 I'm currently looking for work as well, so feel free to share any open technical writer/editor or frontend web jobs you know about with me.
- 📨 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-ferrigan-technical-writer/
- 🧘‍♀️ Pronouns: she/her
- 🐈 Fun fact: I have an insatiable passion for learning and creating new things, which turns into collecting hobbies. In my spare time, I crochet, craft with paper, sculpt with air dry clay, and create and manage websites.
